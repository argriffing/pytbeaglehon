Code by others (all in the C-code in the cPhyProb/ccore directory)
C-Extension were written by adapting Alex Martelli's example code in the 
  Python Cookbook Section 17.1

Among-site rate variation code based on code from the PAML package:

pytbeaglehon is only useful if you have a library installed that fulfills the 
beaglelib API for likelihood computations (
see http://code.google.com/p/beagle-lib/ ). pytbeaglehon links to your copy
of beaglelib, but does not contain code from beagle.
