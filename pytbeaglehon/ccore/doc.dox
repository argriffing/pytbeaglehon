 * If you built this documentation with Doxygen in the default directory, then
 *   there should be a general intro at <a href="../index.html">../index.html</a>
 * 
 * Most functions are not documented (sorry about that...), but the following
 *  functions that are the current "public" API are:
 *   \li #createLikelihoodCalcInstance
 *   \li #getLikeCalculatorInstance
 *   \li #
 *   \li #
 *   \li #
 *   \li #
