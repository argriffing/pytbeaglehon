<h1><a name="top">FatBeagle Library</a></h1>
<p>FatBeagle is a wrapper than <code>libhmsbeagle</code> (see 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/beagle-lib">http://code.google.com/p/beagle-lib</a>).
(Ironically enough, FatBeagle is actually a very thin wrapper around <code>libhmsbeagle</code>;
most of the hard work is done by <code>libhmsbeagle</code>).
</p>
<p>The goals of FatBeagle are to:</p>
<ol>
    <li>provide a slightly richer interface than <code>libhmsbeagle</code>. In particular, FatBeagle will 
calculate the eigensolution from an instantaneous rate matrix, and also provides
functions that make it easier to apply some commonly-used forms of among-site rate variation. </li>
    <li>provide a C-language adaptor for the python-C-extension package, 
<a href="https://github.com/mtholder/pytbeaglehon">pytbeaglehon</a>. FatBeagle is
compiled from the same code-base that is the C-part of <code>pytbeaglehon</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The documentation is currently very poor.
Some <a href="./funcdocs/index.html">function-level documentation</a> is generated
from doxygen.
</p>

<p>Because the implementation of the <code>libhmsbeagle</code> API could be 
operating in what amounts to a distinct address space (e.g. if you are using a 
GPU resource through <code>libhmsbeagle</code>, the memory associated with 
partial likelihood arrays will be stored on the GPU, and not easily accessible 
by the CPU), you must initialize an environment "upfront."
This requires to steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>A call to createLikelihoodCalcInstance which allocates the necessary memory and returns a integer handle;</li>
    <li>A call te getLikeCalculatorInstance to obtain a pointer to a LikeCalculatorInstance object that provides an interface to the environment for likelihood calculations</li>
</ol>

<p><code>pytbeaglehon</code> is only useful if you have a library installed that fulfills the 
beaglelib API for likelihood computations (
see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/beagle-lib">http://code.google.com/p/beagle-lib</a> ).
<code>pytbeaglehon</code> links to your copy
of <code>libhmsbeagle</code>, but does not contain code from beagle.
